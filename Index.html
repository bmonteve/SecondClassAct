        <p>I am from the SFV, and have lived in California my whole life. I moved to SD when I was 18 to start school at UCSD. I graduated in 2018 with a B.S. in Biochemistry. I have two brothers, one older and one younger, and we are all ten years apart. I like to play videogames, watch movies, dance, party, and eat everything in sight. I'm really terrible at writing bios so this last sentence is definitely a filler sentence.
